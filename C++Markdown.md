# Overview
Welcome to the overview of today's code and what the purpose of it. 

The software I wrote is a simple Calculator program in C++ named "Calcky The Calculator." This program allows users to perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. The program prompts the user to enter the first number, the desired operator, and the second number. After receiving input, it performs the requested operation and displays the result to the user.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
Here are the tools that was use for my software and what each of them are and how they work.

### GitHub
>GitHub is a place where programmers store, share, and collaborate on their code, making it easier to work on big projects together and keep track of all the changes. It's like a big, organized playground for building digital stuff.

- Why I used it: to share my code and save it which helped keep track of my changes and show me when I did each change. It also allows me to share it so others like you can look at it.

### CLion 
> CLion is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by JetBrains, primarily designed for C and C++ programming. It offers features such as code assistance, a smart code editor, refactoring tools, an integrated debugger, version control integration, support for the CMake build system, and cross-platform development capabilities. CLion is known for its user-friendliness and is popular among C/C++ developers for its robust feature set. It is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux, with both paid and free licensing options.

- Why I used it: to create and have my software run smoothly.

### Visual Code Studio 
>Visual Studio Code is friendly, free, and smart computer program that makes writing and working with code easier, whether you're building websites, apps, games, or anything else that uses computer languages. It's like having a helpful assistant by your side as you explore the world of coding.

- Why I used it: to create this markdown file.

*Note: I didn't use this tool when actually writing the software since C++ doesn't run on VSC (it can but you need to download other things to make it work)*

# Useful Websites
Down below are websites that I used to help learn and better my understanding of C++ and it might help you if you want to learn the language too

* [w3schools (C++ Introduction)](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp)

* [cplusplus (C++ Language)](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)

*Note: Youtube is also an amazing place to learn a programming language! I was able to find so many tutorials/crash course! I will provide links below*

# Future Work
Here is some things that I could have added or even improve to make the software more advance

- **Memory Functions**: which would allow users to store and recall numbers from memory.

- **Decimal Precision**: which would allow the user to set the decimal precision for the result, especially for division operations.

- **History**: Similar to the memory function this would keep a history of past calculations and allow the user to recall and reuse previous results or expressions.

- **Scientific Calculator Mode**: Implement a mode switch to enable scientific calculator features like trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponentials.
